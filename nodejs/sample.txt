What scientists want to see is definitive action taken to move away from fossil fuels. 
The price of energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar has plummeted over the past decade, 
and in many places these sources are now cheaper than fossil fuels. In a report published on 13 October,
the International Energy Agency projected that under current policies, 
coal consumption will peak and begin to decline as early as 2025;
a peak in oil consumption will follow around a decade later. 
But the global economy still runs on fossil fuels, and scientists say the path forward will be anything but easy.
